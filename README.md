## Project Structure
### Backend
The backend follows standard Models, View, and Controller Architecture here. For that we have a diagram briefly explaining about these things.

![MVC structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/routes/mvc_express.png)

######	Models: A folder having all the database Schemas related to the current Application.
######	Routes: A folder containing the Routes for performing CRUD in database using the frontend.
######	Controllers: The brain of the app. Since controller is a folder having all the functions and scripts for controlling the queries.
######  View: Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.The view means presentation of the model in a particular format. Here we are preparing the models in mongoose dependency.
